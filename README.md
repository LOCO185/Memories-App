## Background story of the porject idea :
I wanted to create a project that is special for me and my friends at the bootcamp to remember the challenging and wonderful period of time that we been through.
creating a project that anyone could share his memory/story and create a post about it.
this way anyone can see each others posts ,can view like and comment on it.
it was a very challenging for us but we made it through !

## How To Use The App :
#### When you visit the app you can view every single post. but you can't like, comment or create unless you signed in.
#### Sign in using google account or Sign up using email registeration.
#### after signing in, create your own post by uploading an image give it a title , message, tags and pressing submit button.
#### You can't make changes on memories, update it or delete it unless you are the owner.

## Future plans of the project :
### Realtime chat on post page.
